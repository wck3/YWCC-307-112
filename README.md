## Individual Presentation: Applications of VR in Hand Rehabilitation

In my individual presentation, I discussed the case for applying virtual realty technologies in the hand rehabilitation process. I gave a brief background on current rehabilitation methods and how without rehabilitation patients injuries can suffer negative long term effects such as chronic pain and PTSD.

I proposed benefits of implimenting VR in rehabilitation and attempted to strengthen my argument by rebuting the counter argument that virtual reality would be too expensive to impliment in hand rehabilitation.
